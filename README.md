# Vagrant Presentation

This is the accompanying text to the Vagrant presentation available
in this repository with comprehensive and structured information
featured on the slides.

Vagrant *(http://vagrantup.com)* is a program for setting up reproducible
and portable development environments easily with a large community.

*Note: This presentation and text talks primarily about using
Vagrant with libvirt provider provided by vagrant-libvirt
plugin on Fedora and derivates. A lot of the information is general
though.*

We are part of Red Hat Developer Experience team. Josef does mostly
Ruby and RubyGems packaging for Fedora and RHEL, and started to
maintain Vagrant in Fedora. We were both involved in getting Vagrant
into Fedora and are co-authors of *vagrant-registration* plugin.

## Agenda

- The Goal &and; Vagrant
- Vagrant components ecosystem
- Using Vagrant as a developer
- Creating your own box
- Finding Vagrant boxes
- Vagrant in Fedora
- Demo

## The Goal

The goal is to have isolated, distributable and portable development environments.

- Isolated so your project's setup does not mess up with your workstation or other projects
- Distributable so new member of your team can just clone your project with Vagrantfile and
get the project running easily by reusing the configuration
- Portable so you can run your project's development environment on Linux, Windows or Mac OS

## Vagrant World

Vagrant is built around hosts, guests, providers and provisioners. Images are distributed in a provider-specific *.box* files
and project's configuration is saved within *Vagrantfile*.

### Definitions

#### Host

- Host operating system (Windows, RHEL), its detection and capabilities (NFS)

Many included by defaults, others by plugins.

#### Guest

- Guest operating system (Ubuntu, OpenBSD, Fedora), its detection and capabilities (halt, insert public key), **virtualized environment**

Many included by defaults, others by plugins.

#### Provider

- Provider of virtual machines or containers used (**VirtualBox**, libvirt, **docker**)

VirtualBox is upstream default and docker support is also included by default.
*libvirt* and others are available via plugins.

#### Provisioner

- Configuration management system to set up (provision) your machine (**Shell, Chef, Puppet**, Ansible)

Shell, Chef and Puppet are included in Vagrant by default.

#### Vagrant box

- Package format including **provider-specific** image plus metadata

#### Vagrantfile

- Definition of configuration and provisioning for a project **on top of a given box**

## Using Vagrant as a Developer

The simplicity behind Vagrant is that developer can checked out a project repository
and -- provided it includes Vagrantfile -- just run `vagrant up` to provision the
machine and to have a shared folder(s) of the project's source code and ports available
so the development would feel pretty much like a local one.

With `vagrant rsync-auto` one can keep auto-syncing the shared folders *(if synced via rsync)*
and with `vagrant ssh` one can access the machine via SSH. Once the work is finished,
one can halt the machine with `vagrant halt` or destroy it with `vagrant destroy`.

```shell
$ ls ~/project
... ... ... Vagrantfile
$ vagrant up # start and provision VMs defined in Vagrantfile
$ vagrant rsync-auto
$ vagrant ssh
```

```shell
$ vagrant halt
$ vagrant destroy
```

## Creating a Vagrant Box

### From Scratch

#### Preparing the Image

To create a desired image for your Vagrant box you need to ensure that
**vagrant** user with sudo rights and without password protection exists.

Vagrant will use this *vagrant* user to access your virtual machine via
SSH which means that SSH has to be present in the virtual machine and
properly set up.

To do so on CentOS 6, one has to install *openssh-server* package, start
and enable the service first:

```shell
# yum install openssh-server
# service sshd start
# chkconfig sshd on
# netstat -tulpn | grep :22
```

For Fedora 21 Server is this already done *by default* so this step can
be skipped.

Vagrant uses SSH keys to access the virtual machine so the public
keys needs to be present on the VM for *vagrant* user.

You can set them easily with the following commands for *vagrant* user:

```shell
$ mkdir .ssh
$ curl -k https://raw.github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/master/keys/vagrant.pub
> .ssh/authorized_keys
$ chmod 0700 .ssh
$ chmod 0600 .ssh/authorized_keys
```

Since Vagrant would do system provisioning and administration,
it needs to have sudo access on the machine. Using `visudo` command on Fedora
you can edit *sudoers* file and ensure that vagrant won't need a password
and have sudo rights with `%vagrant ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL`.

When editing the *sudoers* file make sure that `requiretty` option is
not present (or it is commented out). That is the default on Fedora.
If you would require a real TTY then Vagrant commands sent to the VM
would fail.

Last option to set up when in *sudoers* file is to allow SSH agent
forwarding. You can set that up if you want to use the SSH key from
our local machine inside the Vagrant box.

```
# No password
%vagrant ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
...
# No requiretty, Fedora default
# Defaults    requiretty
...
# SSH agent forwarding
Defaults env_keep += "SSH_AUTH_SOCK"
```

A good practice is also setting up **root** user with password "vagrant",
although it is not necessary for Vagrant to work. Finally you can add
anything you like to the VM. If you would like to do provision with
Chef or Puppet for example, you would need to install them at this time.
But if you would like to have installed Ruby, you can decide whether to
include Ruby in the VM itself or include the installation later in the
Vagrantfile.

#### Packaging VM as Box

Vagrant boxes are simply said just tarred images. What is important to
note is that *.box* files are provider specific. Below is an *libvirt*
example for which you need only the KVM image named as *box.img* and
*metadata.json* file which specifies the provider.

*Example:* vagrant-libvirt provider and Fedora 21 server:

- *qcow2* image file named **box.img**
- optional **Vagrantfile** with defaults
- **metadata.json**

The contents of the metadata file:

```shell
$ cat metadata.json
{
  "provider" : "libvirt",
  "format" : "qcow2",
  "virtual_size" : 40
}
```

Virtual size has to be set for allocating space in storage pool (in GB).

Once you have that prepared, you can just pack it all together using **tar**:

```shell
$ tar cvzf vagrant-fedora-21-server.box ./metadata.json vagrant-fedora-21-server.qcow2
```

### In an Automatic Fashion

You can use a popular Ruby gem **veewee** to build your Vagrant boxes.
It provides a lot of templates for various *providers* and *guests*.

Here is how to find and build a CentOS box with *libvirt* provider:

```shell
$ gem install veewee
$ veewee kvm templates # list available templates for KVM
$ veewee kvm define centos7-x86_64 'CentOS-7.0-1406-x86_64-netinstall' -f
$ veewee kvm build 'centos7-x86_64' --workdir=/home/strzibny
```

That box already comes with <strong>Puppet</strong> and <strong>Chef</strong>
preinstalled as you can see for yourself by examing the template:


```shell
$ ls veewee/templates/CentOS-7.0-1406-x86_64-netinstall/
base.sh
chef.sh
cleanup.sh
definition.rb
ks.cfg
puppet.sh
vagrant.sh
virtualbox.sh
vmfusion.sh
zerodisk.sh
```

Template is just a collection of shell scripts that are run on the base VM
to set it up for use as Vagrant box. `definition.rb` is an internal veewee
definition for the box to be set up.

## Finding Vagrant Boxes

Originally there was an official Vagrant Cloud *(vagrantcloud.com)* service that is being merged
into a new service called Atlas *(atlas.hashicorp.com)*.

With Atlas it's enough to:

```shell
vagrant up chef/centos-6.5 --provider virtualbox
```
and the corresponding box will be downloaded from HashiCorp servers.

A good unofficial alternative is *http://www.vagrantbox.es/*. You can
add boxes from a given URL:

```shell
$ vagrant box add {title} {url}
$ vagrant init {title}
$ vagrant up
```
or add them with `vagrant box add` command.


## Vagrant in Fedora

### Vagrant in Fedora 22

Vagrant has been submitted as a Fedora 22 feature together with *vagrant-libvirt* plugin.
As Vagrant is already built for Fedora 22 in the official repositories it is enough to run:

```shell
# dnf install vagrant-libvirt
```

to install Vagrant with libvirt support. libvirt is the new default provider in Fedora builds.

We would like to introduce a new **@vagrant** group in Fedora that should install all packaged
plugins.

### Older Fedoras and RHEL

Following Copr repositories were created to install Vagrant on Fedora 20, 21 and as a software
collection on RHEL.

- [jstribny/vagrant-f20](http://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/jstribny/vagrant-f20)
- [jstribny/vagrant-f21](http://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/jstribny/vagrant-f21)
- [jstribny/vagrant1 software collection](http://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/jstribny/vagrant1)

## Official RPM

It is also possible to run the official RPM from *https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html* which
comes with VirtualBox provider as a default. You will still need to download and install
VirtualBox yourself.

If you would like to use *libvirt* provider with the upstream package, you need to install
*vagrant-libvirt* plugin with:

```shell
vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt
```
## Vagrant files in detail
Vagrant files:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:strzibny/vagrant-presentation.git 
```
Unofficial Fedora Cloud box:
https://atlas.hashicorp.com/humaton/boxes/fedora-21-cloud

```shell
vagrant box add humaton/fedora-21-cloud
vagrant up humaton/fedora-21-cloud --provider libvirt
vagrant ssh
```
